### Technical

Seminal papers on the Principle of Maximum Entropy by Edwin T. Jaynes (July 5, 1922 – April 30, 1998):

*   Jaynes, E. T. "[Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics (PDF - 2.1 MB)](http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/theory.1.pdf)." _Physical Review_ 106 (May 15, 1957): 620–630.  
    This paper started the use of the Principle of Maximum Entropy in physics.
*   ———. "[Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics II (PDF - 3.6 MB)](http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/theory.2.pdf)." _Physical Review_ 108 (October 15, 1957): 171–190.  
    Continuation of the previous reference.
*   The philosophy of assuming maximum uncertainty is discussed in Chapter 3 of Tribus, M. _Thermostatics and Thermodynamics_. Princeton, NJ: D. Van Nostrand Co, Inc., 1961.
*   Another good explanation, in terms of estimating probabilities of an unfair die is in Jaynes, E. T. "[Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics (PDF)](http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/brandeis.pdf)." In _Statistical Physics_. Brandeis Summer Institute 1962. New York, NY: W. A. Benjamin, Inc., 1963. pp. 181–218.
*   [![Buy at MIT Press](/images/mp_logo.gif)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262120807) Personal history by Jaynes, Edwin T. "[Where Do We Stand on Maximum Entropy? (PDF - 2.5 MB)](http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/stand.on.entropy.pdf)" In [_The Maximum Entropy Formalism_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262120807). Edited by Raphael D. Levine and Myron Tribus. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1978. pp. 15-118. ISBN: 9780262120807.

### Historical

*   [Joseph-Louis Lagrange biography](http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/Biographies/Lagrange.html)
*   Cercignani, Carlo. _Ludwig Boltzmann, The Man Who Trusted Atoms_. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2006. ISBN: 9780198570646.  
    Biography of Ludwig Boltzmann, Austrian physicist, 1844–1906, who was a pioneer in thermodynamics and entropy.
*   [Ludwig Boltzmann biography](https://www.boltzmann.com/ludwig-boltzmann/biography/)
*   Another Ludwig [Boltzmann biography](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ludwig-Boltzmann)
*   Truesdell, C. _The Tragicomical History of Thermodynamics, 1822–1854_. Berlin, Germany: Springer-Verlag, 1980. ISBN: 9780387904030.  
    History of the twisted and convoluted development of the difficult concept of entropy. Professor Truesdell died January 14, 2000 at the age of 80. He retired from the faculty at Johns Hopkins University in 1989.
*   Edwin T. Jaynes [biography](http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/etj.html), [photograph](http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/phys.photo.html), and [bibliography](http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/node1.html).

### Books

There are many textbooks on thermodynamics and energy conversion.

*   Silbey, R., R. Alberty, and M. Bawendi. _Physical Chemistry_. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, 2004. ISBN: 9780471215042.  
    These authors are from MIT. Alberty was formerly Dean of Science, and Silbey was until recently Dean of Science. It's amazing that anyone can be a Dean and still keep up with science.
*   Typical excellent book in a traditional style, Zemansky, Mark W. _Heat and Thermodynamics_. 3rd ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 1951, or earlier editions starting in 1937.  
    This book does not mention information and starts with assumed knowledge about temperature, pressure, and volume. Suitable for advanced undergraduates.
*   Introductory book, used for sophomores, covering classical thermodynamics (no information), Van Ness, H. C. _Understanding Thermodynamics_. New York, NY: Dover Publications, 1969.  
    Succinct and carefully crafted treatment.
*   Book covering both equilibrium and irreversible thermodynamics, Callen, Herbert B. _Thermodynamics_. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, 1962.
*   Careful treatment of classical thermodynamics (no mention of information) with emphasis on the mathematical formalism, Truesdell, C. _Rational Thermodynamics_. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 1969.  
    Suitable for graduate courses, for those with some prior exposure to thermodynamics.
*   Textbook developed at MIT in energy conversion (no thermodynamics), White, David C., and Herbert H. Woodson. _Electromechanical Energy Conversion_. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, 1959.
*   An early textbook to use the Principle of Maximum Entropy as an approach to thermodynamics is Tribus, M. _Thermostatics and Thermodynamics_. Princeton, NJ: D. Van Nostrand Co, Inc., 1961.
