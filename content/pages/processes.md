### Technical

*   Shannon, Claude E. "A Mathematical Theory of Communication." _Bell System Technical Journal_ 27 (July and October 1948): 379–423 (Part I), 623–656 (Part II). These seminal papers are available in several forms.
    *   [Original papers (PDF)](http://worrydream.com/refs/Shannon%20-%20A%20Mathematical%20Theory%20of%20Communication.pdf), with corrections but without Shannon's 1949 modifications.
    *   Shannon, Claude E., and Warren Weaver. _The Mathematical Theory of Communication_. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1998. ISBN: 9780252725463. (Incorporating a number of modifications and corrections by Shannon.)
    *   Shannon, Claude E. "A Mathematical Theory of Communication." 50th Anniversary Edition, printed for the 1998 _IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory_. New York, NY: IEEE Press, August 16–21, 1998. ISBN: 9780780350007. (Based on 1949 book, with corrections.)
    *   Reprinted in _Key Papers in the Development of Information Theory_. Edited by D. Slepian. New York, NY: IEEE Press, 1974.
    *   Reprinted in _Claude Elwood Shannon: Collected Papers_. Edited by N. J. A. Sloane, and A. D. Wyner. New York, NY: IEEE Press, 1993. ISBN: 9780780304345.Because he treated a general case, Shannon was able to distinguish loss and noise, in the way done in 6.050J/2.110J. Many others treat only channels with similar inputs and outputs in which case often L = N so it may not be obvious why they are different concepts.

### Historical

*   [Claude E. Shannon](http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Shannon.html) (1916–2001). [Obituary](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2001/obitshannon-0228.html), MIT News, Feb 28, 2001.
*   Gallager, Robert G. "Claude E. Shannon: A Retrospective on His Life, Work, and Impact." _IEEE Transactions on Information Theory_ 47 (November 2001): 2681–2695.
*   The process model is also known as Markov Processes or Markov Chains after [Andrei A. Markov](http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Markov.html) (1856–1922).

### General Technical Books

There are many excellent texts on communications, most of which assume a familiarity with mathematics beyond introductory calculus. Some have treatments of the discrete memoryless channel, but not with the same emphasis given here. Here are a few:

*   Gallager, Robert G. _Information Theory and Reliable Communications_. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1968. ISBN: 9780471290483.  
    One of the early textbooks, designed for first-year graduate students.
*   Hambley, Allan R. _An Introduction to Communication Systems_. New York, NY: W. H. Freeman, 1989. ISBN: 9780716781844.
*   Cover, Thomas M., and Joy A. Thomas. _Elements of Information Theory_. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2006. ISBN: 9780471241959.  
    Aimed at university seniors and first-year graduate students. One of several excellent books of that era.
*   Haykin, Simon. _Communication Systems_. 4th ed. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2000. ISBN: 9780471178699.
