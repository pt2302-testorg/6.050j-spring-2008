    A charming introduction to superdense coding, in which the transmission of a classical bit can convey more than a bit of information if the channel is set up in advance using quantum entanglement.
*   Feynman, Richard P. "Simulating Physics with Computers." _International Journal of Theoretical Physics_ 21 (1982): 467–488.  
    Keynote speech at a conference held at MIT that was one of the first in the newly developing field of quantum information.

### Technical

*   Prof. [John Preskill](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/) teaches a [course on quantum information](http://www.theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/ph219/index.html) at Caltech. [Lecture notes](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/ph219/chap2_13.pdf).
*   [Centre for Quantum Computation](http://www.qubit.org/), University of Oxford.
*   One of the most active industrial research groups in quantum information is at [IBM Research Yorktown](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/). This was the home of one of the early leaders in the field, the late Rolf Landauer, and younger people including Charles Bennett, who is known for his work on quantum teleportation.

### Historical

*   [Rolf Landauer obituary](http://physicsweb.org/article/news/03/4/21)
*   [Richard P. Feynman biography](http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Feynman.html). Feynman, an MIT graduate, was curious about the nature of quantum information.

### Books

There are already many books and conferences on quantum information, even though the field is new.

*   Lo, Hoi-Kwong, Sandu Popescu, and Tim Spiller. _Introduction to Quantum Computation and Information_. River Edge, NJ: World Scientific, 1999. ISBN: 9789810233990.  
    The book is based on a lecture series held at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Bristol, UK, November 1996 – April, 1997.
*   Nielsen, Michael A., and Isaac L. Chuang. _Quantum Computation and Quantum Information_. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2000. ISBN: 9780521635035.  
    This is probably the best of the books intended for scientists and engineers. Chuang, an MIT graduate, is currently on the MIT faculty.
*   Bouwbeester, Dirk, Artur Ekert, and Anton Zeilinger. _The Physics of Quantum Information: Quantum Cryptography, Quantum Teleportation, Quantum Computation_. Berlin, Germany: Springer-Verlag, 2000. ISBN: 9783540667780.
*   Shapiro, Jeffrey H., and Hirota, Osamu. _Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Quantum Communication, Measurement, and Computing_. Edited by Jeffrey H. Shapiro and Osamu Hirota. Princeton, NJ: Rinton Press, 2003. ISBN: 9781589490307.
*   Johnson, George. _A Shortcut through Time: The Path to the Quantum Computer_. New York, NY: Alfred A. Knopf, 2003. ISBN: 9780375411939.  
    This book, written by a New York Times science writer, is for the general public and may not be technical enough for some readers.

[James Clerk Maxwell](http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Maxwell.html) opened up the relationship between information and entropy by proposing what is called today Maxwell's Demon, which would apparently violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Maxwell's Demon in its many forms has captured the imagination of both scientists and the general public.

*   Brillouin, Leon. _Science and Information Theory_. 2nd ed. New York, NY: Dover, 2004. ISBN: 9780486439181.  
    Topics include Brownian motion, thermal noise, information theory, entropy, and the author's personal view of Maxwell's Demon.
*   Leff, Harvey S., and Andrew F. Rex. _Maxwell's Demon: Entropy, Information, Computing_. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1991. ISBN: 9780691087276.  
    General historical discussion with many reprints of original papers but not, regrettably, any of Maxwell's own publications.
*   von Baeyer, Hans Christian. _Maxwell's Demon_. New York, NY: Random House, 1998. ISBN: 9780679433422.  
    A very good review for the general public, by a Professor of Physics at the College of William and Mary. This book was written before the quantum version of the demon was understood as well as it is today.
